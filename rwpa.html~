<p>
This paper talks about the flexibility and power needed in the data
channel for computer display, it also looks at the design of the 
display processor (control part of the display) and how it was 
found that making successive improvements to design of display processor
lie on a circular path. It also talks about the various challenges faced
in associating the display with the core computer.

<li>The display that the authors are designing is for SDS-940 time shared

<li>SDS-940 was the first machine designed to directly support
time-sharing. (Multiple users using single machine)</li>

<p>
When the authors decided to design the display processor, it got so complex
and it resembled a full fledged computer with some special graphic features,
and then a strange thing happened, the authors were compelled to add a 
second, subsidary processor, which itself began to grow in size, it continued
and authors found that they were stuck in this never ending cyclic process.
They called it wheel of Reincarnation.

<h3 id="orgd4e865b"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Stages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Display from core's central registers.</li>
<li>Introducing a data channel.</li>
<li>Drawing lines and characters.</li>
<li>Introducing

<li>HALT command.</li>
<li>JUMP command.</li>
<li>Subroutine feature for repetitive symbols.</li>

<section id="slide-org782a9e1">
<h3 id="org782a9e1"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Realisation:</h3>
<p>
We should realize that display data channel is not a mere data channel,
but is a processor.
</p>

<h3 id="org0ab4702"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> </h3>
<p>
So, if we take a look at the design, we have built up display channel
until it itself is a general purpose processor with a display. The
display is tied directly to its processor, to generate a picture the
display processor's central registers are used. In short, we have come
<span class="underline">exactly around once</span> the wheel of reincarnation.
</p>

<p>
However, we have made significant developement, we have added support
for many things in the process.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgfd432f5">
<h3 id="orgfd432f5"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> </h3>
<p>
Now, we might argue that much of display processor's power is idle most
of the time and that it is wasteful to tie up a general purpose processor
merely to refresh a static display, therefore we might consider adding
a <i>channel</i> to display processor, which can have some special commands
to let it follow more complex data structures, <b>but</b> if we do this, we 
would be move into a second turn around the wheel.
</p>

<p>
Looking at commercial displays at that time, one can find many examples
at various points around the wheel, but none stopping exactly at one
revolution around the wheel.

<section id="slide-org7fc0396">
<h3 id="org7fc0396"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Questions:</h3>
<p>
Viewing this from a broader view, we see that there are mainly two
questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How closer should the display system be tied to parent systems?</li>
<li>How much computing power should be included in the display processor?</li>

</ul>

<p>
The authors favor keeping the display close to the parent system,
inspite of memory problems (if it had been far, it would have separate
memory and we wouldn't face these).
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgec62348">
<h3 id="orgec62348"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> How much computing power?</h3>
<p>
Depends on what we want to do with our display processor.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The display processor must generate pictures from some form of 
internal representation, which may include multiple calls
on display subroutines.</li>
<li>Display element might generate pictures from computation rather
than static representation in memory. (light-pens etc)</li>
<li>Display processor might provide immediate feedback to user or handle
simple interactive functions such as editing, light-pen tracking.</li>
<li>The display processor should handle rotation, scaling etc when
these are not handled by the display hardware.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="slide-org716135e">
<h3 id="org716135e"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Escaping the wheel</h3>
<p>
The view suggested by Daniel Bobrow that the display processor need
not contain general purpose computing power, largely determined the
design of the display processor.
</p>

<p>
General computing power should come from central resources of the
system, if there are no enough resources to do particular thing it's
fault of the system not the display. The display should mostly be concerned
with displaying the points. This decision let's us escape from
the wheel of reincarnation.
