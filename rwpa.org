* Authors

  This paper was written by T.H Myer and I.E Sutherland with inputs from
  Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.

  - I.E Sutherland is a computer scientist and Internet pioneer, he was 
    widely regarded as _father of computer graphics_.
 
  - He received Turing award from Association for Computing Machinery in
    _1988_ for invention of sketchpad, an early predecessor to GUI.

* Introduction
  
  This paper talks about the flexibility and power needed in the data
  channel for computer display, it also looks at the design of the 
  display processor (control part of the display) and how it was 
  found that making successive improvements to design of display processor
  lie on a circular path. It also talks about the various challenges faced
  in associating the display with the core computer.

** Context  

   - The display that the authors are designing is for SDS-940 time shared 
     computer system.

     - SDS-940 was the first machine designed to directly support
       time-sharing. (Multiple users using single machine)

* The Wheel of Reincarnation

  When the authors decided to design the display processor, it got so complex
  and it resembled a full fledged computer with some special graphic features,
  and then a strange thing happened, the authors were compelled to add a 
  second, subsidary processor, which itself began to grow in size, it continued
  and authors found that they were stuck in this never ending cyclic process.
  They called it wheel of Reincarnation.

** Stages:
   
   - Display from core's central registers.
   - Introducing a data channel.
   - Drawing lines and characters.
   - Introducing
     - HALT command.
     - JUMP command.
     - Subroutine feature for repetitive symbols.
     - Store-exit command.

** Realisation:
   
   We should realize that display data channel is not a mere data channel,
   but is a processor.

** Further improvements:

   - Introducing stack.
   - Adding conditional commands for interactive programs.
   - Transparency by parameter passing.
   - Global variables support.

** Full-Blown processor
